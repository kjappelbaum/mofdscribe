class MOF:
    """A container for a MOF structure.

    The MOF class is the container for a MOF structure. It contains at least
    the structure itself, but can also contain additional information such as

    - the structure graph
    - the fragments
    - the hashes

    The MOF class is a conenient input for the featurizers because
    they can simply take whatever they need from the MOF class.
    Additionally, expensive computations such as the structure graph
    or the fragments can be cached in the MOF class.

    This not only simplifies the featurizer code, but also makes it
    possible to reuse the artifacts of the MOF class for other purposes.

    .. note::

        By default, the MOF class will use :py:obj:`~pymatgen.core.structure.IStructure`
        as the structure container. This is because we want to make sure that there is
        no way tht the inputs are mutated during the featurization process.

        However, some aspects of ``matminer`` require the use of :py:obj:`~pymatgen.core.structure.Structure`
        as the structure container. The corresponding matminer adapter will deal with this.
        However, we cannot strictly enfore immutability of the structure container in this case.
