    Conventionally, energy grids can be used to speed up molecular simulations.
    The idea is that the interactions between the guest and host are pre-computed
    on a fine grid and then only need to be looked up (instead of re-computed all the time).

    Bucior et al. proposed (effectively) a dimensionality reduction of the energy grid by
    making a histogram of the energies.

    This approach has also been used, for example, `Li et al. (2021) <https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0050823>`_
