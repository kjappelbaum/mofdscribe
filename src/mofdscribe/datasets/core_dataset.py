    """Dataset of gas uptake related features for a subset of CoRE MOFs.

    The labels were computed by Moosavi et al. (2020) [Moosavi2020]_.

    To reduce the risk of data leakage, we  (by default) also only keep one representative
    structure for a "base refcode" (i.e. the first five letters of a refcode).
    For instance, the base refcode for IGAHED001 is IGAHED. Structures with same
    base refcode but different refcodes are often different refinements, or measurements
    at different temperatures and hence chemically quite similar. For instance,
    the base refcode `TOWPEC` would appear 60 times, `NARVUA` 22 times and so on.
    Additionally, we (by default) only keep one structure per "structure hash"
    which is an approximate graph-isomoprhism check, assuming the VESTA bond thresholds
    for the derivation of the structure graph.

    .. warning::
        Even though we performed some basic sanity checks, there are currently still
        some structures that might chemically not be reasonable.
        Also, even though we only keep one structure per base refcode, there is still
        potential for data leakge. We urge users to still drop duplicates (or close neighbors)
        after featurization.

        If this set is used as test set, make sure to drop all overlapping entries in your training set.

    The years refer to the publication dates of the paper crossreferenced
    in the CSD entry of the structure. We excluded structures that are not
    deposited in the CSD.

    The available labels are:


        * 'pure_CO2_kH': Henry coefficient of CO2 obtained by Widom method in mol kg-1 Pa-1
        * 'pure_CO2_widomHOA': Heat of adsorption of CO2 obtained by Widom method in
