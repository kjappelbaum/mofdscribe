3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
available in Executable form must also be made available in
Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
from the rights set forth in this License. If You
distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
the license and remove any references to the name of the
license steward (except to note that the license differs
from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
or the Original Software where the Participant is the
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
Participant Software against such Participant either
unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
United States export administration regulations (and the export
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
of liability.
