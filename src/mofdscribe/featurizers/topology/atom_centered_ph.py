    This featurizer is an abstraction of the on described in the work of Jiang
    et al. (2021) [Jiang2021]_. It computes the persistence diagrams for the
    neighborhood of every site and then aggregates the diagrams by computing
    certain statistics.

    To use this featurizer on a complete structure without additional
    resolutions over the chemistry, you can wrap it in a
    :class:`~matminer.featurizers.structure.SiteStatsFingerprint`.

        >>> from matminer.featurizers.structure import SiteStatsFingerprint
        >>> from mofdscribe.topology.atom_centered_ph import AtomCenteredPHSite
        >>> featurizer = SiteStatsFingerprint(AtomCenteredPHSite())
