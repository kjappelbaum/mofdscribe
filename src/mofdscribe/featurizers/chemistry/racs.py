    r"""Modified version of the revised autocorrelation functions (RACs) for MOFs.

    Originally proposed by Moosavi et al. (10.1038/s41467-020-17755-8).
    In the original paper, RACs were computed as

    .. math::
        {}_{{\rm{scope}}}^{{\rm{start}}}{P}_{d}^{{\rm{diff}}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i}^{{\rm{start}}}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j}^{{\rm{scope}}}({P}_{i}-{P}_{j})\delta ({d}_{i,j},d). # noqa: E501

    Here, we allow to replace the double sum by different aggregations. We call
    this `corr_agg`. The default `sum` is equivalent to the original RACS.
    Moreover, the implementation here keeps track of different linker/node
    molecules and allows to compute and aggregate the RACS for each molecule
    separately. The `bb_agg` feature then determines how those RACs for each BB
    are aggregated. The `sum` is equivalent to the original RACS (i.e. all
    applicable linker atoms would be added to the start/scope lists).

    Note that the "bbs" define the start atoms. However, we still consider the whole
    neighborhood of each start atom (i.e., including atoms that are not part of this "bb").

    Furthermore, here we allow to allow any of the
    `element-coder <https://github.com/kjappelbaum/element-coder>`_ properties to be used as
    `property` :math:`P_{i}`.

    To use to original implementation, see `molSimplify
    <https://github.com/hjkgrp/molSimplify>`_.
