I checked that my PR


- [ ] adds a new `.json` file into the correct subfolder if the `bench` directory
<!-- Please ensure that this .json file has been generated using a .bench() method in mofdscribe -->

- [ ] adds a new `.rst` file with description of my model based on the `bench_results/model_description_template.rst`
<!-- Feel free to include any content that can be visualized in rst. At the moment, it is best if you include images etc. via an external URL. -->
