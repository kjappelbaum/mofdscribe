Contributing
------------------

You want your model to appear here? Then

1. Run the :code:`bench` method for the task you want to contribute to.
2. Create a pull request with the :code:`json` file produced by the :code:`bench` method and fill the pull request template.

If you have a general-purpose model you might be interested in also submitting it to the `matbench <https://matbench.materialsproject.org>`_ leaderboard. We're currently investigating how to integrate the leaderboard into the matbench project.

If you have a modeling approach for a task that is not yet covered in the leaderboards, please open a new issue, and we'll make sure to add it.
